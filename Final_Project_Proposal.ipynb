    "The data for the project is the **Speed Dating Experiment** data by Anna Montoya.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data contains the process of 21 speed dating experiments between October 16, 2002 and April 7, 2004. The participants spend approximately 4 minutes with other participants and get to know them. In the end there is a decision column, in binary form which indicates whether they would like to see that person again. What makes this experiment exciting is the surveys participants fill out throughout, before and after the dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good data to test if how people percieve love (at first sight) change based on their preferences or if there are universal attributes that can create chemistry between two people. The data allows us to analysize participants' background and personalities, and what they ideally look for, in a partner. \n",

    "* The main hypothesis I want to test is based on the common saying which is **opposites attract**.  I want to see whether this is true or not. I can test this by defining what opposites mean? Does it mean different races, different religion beliefs or different interests? I can test by creating several categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Are there participants who match with people who have opposite qualities they specified in their before date survey? Do people change their minds and drop their preferences once they meet someone they'd like to match? (For example imagine a participant said they want to date someone with the same race as them, in the end do they match with someone in a different race?)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Based on the surveys filled out before the dates what are the main qualities people look for in the opposite gender? Do these answers differ for women and men? I would expect that women and men give different answers to this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do people's primary goal in participating in this event affect their outcome? (For example should we expect people who are looking for a serious relationship to find more or less matches than the ones who are not.)"
