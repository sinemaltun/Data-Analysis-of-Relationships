    "This data contains the process of 21 speed dating experiments between October 16, 2002 and April 7, 2004. The participants spend approximately 4 minutes with other participants and get to know them. In the end there is a decision column, in binary form which indicates whether they would like to see that person again. What makes this experiment exciting is the surveys participants fill out throughout, before and after the dates. \n",

The data allows us to analysize participants' background and personalities, and what they ideally look for, in a partner. \n",
